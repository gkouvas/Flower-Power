# Flower-Power
Python script to achieve direct Bluetooth connection to Parrot's Flower Power device.
A pre-requisite is that you have an active Parrot's Flower Power device.
Here is the device's User Manual: https://www.parrot.com/assets/s3fs-public/2021-09/flower-power_user-guide_uk.pdf 
Note that the device is not supported by Parrot anymore, hence I wrote this python script.
For any questions you can contact me.
